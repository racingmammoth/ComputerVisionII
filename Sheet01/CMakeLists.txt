# Computer Vision Lecture MA-INF 2201
#
# CMakeLists.txt for exercise 01
# see http://www.cmake.org/ for a documentation about CMake
#
# compile your programm using the following commands:
#
# Enter build folder
# $ cd build
#
# !!! To Make an Eclipse Project you should use the Generator in the following way
# .../Exercise01/build/$ cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" ../
# .../Exercise01/build/$ make

# OR

# !!! To Make an ordinary Unix Makefile project you can use the Generator in the following way
# .../Exercise01/build/$ cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ../
# .../Exercise01/build/$ make

# !!! NOTE
# With the way described above you will be sure that 
# created cmake files  will be stored in build folder ,and 
# binary files will be stored in the bin folder
# which you should not version while using the SVN

# Please, When you test your program from terminal after compilation
# switch back to main exercise folder and run your program as following
# .../Exercise01/$ ./bin/sheet01

#set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE debug)					# choose if you want to compile with or without debugging flags,
set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE release)					# uncomment only one of the following two commands at a time

#To build the project openCV is required
find_package( OpenCV REQUIRED )

#Include Required Directories

# Create a shared library (To use library creation uncomment the following)
#	add_library(	
#		LIBRARY_NAME 
#		${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/some.cpp
#		${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/someMore.cpp
#		)

#Create an Executable for segment
add_executable(sheet01 ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/sheet01.cpp)	#Add executable to sheet01.cpp
target_link_libraries( sheet01 ${OpenCV_LIBS} )			#Link the executable with opencv library
 
#(If you want to add subprojects to your main the following is how you do)
#Continue with subdirectory 
# add_subdirectory(SubFolder/That/Contains/Another/CMakeLists.txt)
